# Googolplex Search
This project is a mock Google search engine built using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. It provides the user the ability to search the internet, perform a random search with the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button, and get the current time, as well as change the background by clicking on the Googolplex title. The search results are generated using Serper API, which provides search results based on the user's query.
